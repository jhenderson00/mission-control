fix: only show HeartbeatIndicator for offline/paused states

The agent status (idle/active/blocked/failed) and heartbeat status
(online/offline/busy/paused) were both displayed, causing confusion
when showing 'idle' and 'BUSY' simultaneously.

Now HeartbeatIndicator only appears when it indicates a problem:
- offline: agent not reachable
- paused: agent explicitly paused

This removes visual clutter when agents are operating normally.
